# Package: sansSouci

## Version: 0.1.3 [2016-01-20]

* changed names of return values of 'getJointFWERThresholds' for consistency with the notation of the BNR paper.
* added test script for unbalancedness.

## Version: 0.1.2 [2016-01-07]

* BUG FIX: the one-parameter family should not be updated at each step down!
* Example fixed accordingly.
* Implemented the "Oracle" version of step-down control.

## Version: 0.1.1 [2015-12-17]

* added scripts to test step-down JFWER control

## Version: 0.1.0 [2015-12-10]

* Tentative implementation of Etienne's trick to avoid dichotomy in 'getJointFWERThresholds'. Quite slow for kFWER thresholds.
